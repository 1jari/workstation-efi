# My Workstation EFI

This is my OpenCore-based workstation files.
My specs:

* **CPU:** Intel Core I5-3470 (Ivy-Bridge)
* **RAM:** 8 GB (DDR4)
* **Chipset:** H61
* **GPU:** Biostar RX 580 2048SP
* **OS:** MacOS 11 Big Sur

## About the GPU:
RX 580 2048SP is a "special kind" of these chinese video-cards.
They are actually an overclocked **Ellesmere**-based GPU, with a different VBIOS.
So, to make it work in MacOS, you will need to flash **biostar-rx580.rom".
